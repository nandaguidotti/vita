# Vita

**VITA** is a modular and extensible platform resulting from doctoral research, designed to enable the practical implementation of the **6C Architecture** for Artificial Intelligence in industrial systems.

VITA represents the **Visionary Industrial Technology Architecture**, conceived as an operational instantiation of the 6C Architecture, translating its theoretical principles into a concrete, scalable, and deployable technological solution for real-world industrial environments.

## Research Context

The doctoral thesis entitled **“6C Architecture: A Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Industry”** proposes the 6C Architecture as a conceptual and architectural model for the development of intelligent industrial systems.

As outcomes of this research, both the **6C Architecture** and **VITA** emerged as complementary results. While the 6C Architecture defines the conceptual, structural, and methodological principles, VITA provides the technological foundation that enables their empirical validation and practical adoption in industrial scenarios.

VITA was conceived to bridge the gap between architectural theory and industrial practice, supporting the full lifecycle of industrial AI systems, from data acquisition to continuous learning and system evolution.

## Purpose

The main purpose of VITA is to:
- Enable the practical implementation of the 6C Architecture in industrial contexts
- Provide a modular and scalable technological foundation for industrial AI systems
- Support the development, deployment, monitoring, and evolution of intelligent systems
- Materialize architectural principles into an operational and reproducible platform

## Architectural Perspective

Although delivered as a software platform, VITA embodies an **architectural instantiation** of the 6C principles. Its design defines structural, functional, and operational aspects of industrial AI systems, including modularity, separation of concerns, interoperability, and continuous feedback across layers.

Each module of VITA is aligned with one of the layers of the 6C Architecture, enabling a coherent flow from data connection and conversion to cognition, configuration, and system consciousness.

## Status

VITA represents a consolidated research outcome from doctoral work. The platform may continue to evolve through extensions, adaptations, and future research or industrial initiatives.
